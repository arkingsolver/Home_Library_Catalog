Embryos and Idiots*Larissa Szporluk*http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FOFlAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api*No Publisher Info*2007*English*"""This is poetry both luscious and rigorous.""-Lynn Emanuel This latest collection from the young but already established luminary Larissa Szporluk is cause for celebration. Szporluk has proven once again that she not only deserves her elevated status in the poetry world, but reinvents and advances it with each new collection. This is spare, sly, seductive, and haunting poetry that resonates long after the rustle of the page. Szporluk has an uncanny ability to hone her words until their edges slice like small, deep paper cuts, whittling away at the human experience, searching for the truth of things. Despite her three previously published-and much heralded-works, this visionary poet continues to innovate. She remains completely unpredictable, as if these visceral poems lead her to extraordinary places of their own volition. She writes of mother-son relationships, political and social events-always with an underlying mythic aspect, and always demonstrating an undeniable faith in the human spirit. Larissa Szporluk is the author of three books of poetry: Dark Sky Question, winner of the Barnard College Poetry Prize; Isolato, winner of the Iowa Poetry Prize; and The Wind, Master Cherry, the Wind. She received a 1998 Rona Jaffe Writers' Award, and her poems have been widely anthologized in The Best American Poetry 1999, The Beacon Best of 1999, New American Voices, and Young American Poets. She is assistant professor of creative writing and literature at Bowling Green State University."*9781932195521

Time and Materials*Robert Hass*http://books.google.com/books/content?id=E4_kMBFoOSIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api*Harper Collins*2007-10-09*English*"The poems in Robert Hass's new collection—his first to appear in a decade—are grounded in the beauty and energy of the physical world, and in the bafflement of the present moment in American culture. This work is breathtakingly immediate, stylistically varied, redemptive, and wise. His familiar landscapes are here—San Francisco, the Northern California coast, the Sierra high country—in addition to some of his oft-explored themes: art; the natural world; the nature of desire; the violence of history; the power and limits of language; and, as in his other books, domestic life and the conversation between men and women. New themes emerge as well, perhaps: the essence of memory and of time. The works here look at paintings, at Gerhard Richter as well as Vermeer, and pay tribute to his particular literary masters, friend Czesław Miłosz, the great Swedish poet Tomas Tranströmer, Horace, Whitman, Stevens, Nietszche, and Lucretius. We are offered glimpses of a surpris­ingly green and vibrant twenty-first-century Berlin; of the demilitarized zone between the Koreas; of a Bangkok night, a Mexican desert, and an early summer morning in Paris, all brought into a vivid present and with a passionate meditation on what it is and has been to be alive. ""It has always been Mr. Hass's aim,"" the New York Times Book Review wrote, ""to get the whole man, head and heart and hands and every­thing else, into his poetry."" Every new volume by Robert Hass is a major event in poetry, and this beautiful collection is no exception."*9780061349607

Real sofistikashun*Tony Hoagland*http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TN9kAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api*Graywolf Pr*2006-09-19*English*The anticipated first collection of essays by celebrated poet Tony Hoagland, author of What Narcissism Means to Me Meanness, the very thing that is unforgivable in human social life, in poetry is thrilling and valuable. Why? Because the willingness to be offensive sets free the ruthless observer in all of us, the spiteful perceptive angel who sees and tells, unimpeded by nicety or second thoughts. There is truth-telling, and more, in meanness. —from “Negative Capability: How to Talk Mean and Influence People” Tony Hoagland has won The Poetry Foundation’s Mark Twain Award, recognizing a poet’s contribution to humor in American poetry, and also the Folger Shakespeare Library’s O. B. Hardison Jr. Poetry Prize, the only major award that honors a poet’s excellence in teaching. Real Sofistikashun, from the title onward, uses Hoagland’s signature abilities to entertain and instruct as he forages through central questions about how poems behave and how they are made. In these taut, illuminating essays, Hoagland explores aspects of poetic craft—metaphor, tone, rhetorical and compositional strategies—with the vigorous, conversational style less of the scholar than of the serious enthusiast and practitioner. Real Sofistikashun is an exciting, humorous, and provocative collection of essays, as pleasurable a book as it is useful.*9781555974558
